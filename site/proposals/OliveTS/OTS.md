## Budget Disclaimer

Certainly, let's clarify the specifics related to the Digital Advertising and what is included in the charges.

### Digital Advertising Budget Inclusions:

**Pay-per-click (PPC) Budget:** The cost for the PPC strategy, keyword research, ad creation, and campaign setup is included. The ad spend itself would be billed to the client.

 **Social Media Advertising:** Similar to PPC, this includes strategy, audience targeting, and ad creation, but not the actual ad spend. Costs for running the campaigns on platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, etc., would be charged to the client.

**Retargeting Campaigns:** This covers the planning, segmentation, and creation of retargeting campaigns to engage users who have previously interacted with your brand. The actual ad spend is separate and would be billed to the client.

### Channels Used for Marketing:

**Online Channels:** All strategies and plans for online marketing are included in the quoted costs. However, the spend on the actual digital channels (Google Ads, LinkedIn, etc.) will be charged to the client.
  
**Offline Channels:** Strategy and planning for offline channels like trade shows, print media, and TV spots are included. The costs for booth rentals, print runs, and TV airtime would be separate and billed to the client.

### Content Creation:

The quoted charges cover content creation for digital and offline marketing strategies, including copywriting and static images for social media posts or ad campaigns.

### Note:
> Video production and other forms of multimedia are not included in the initial quote. Only static images will be used for the post or ad campaigns.


This pricing structure ensures that you pay only for the specific services that fall within the scope of content creation and digital advertising strategy, while having the flexibility to manage your own media budgets.

## Brand Logos
The inspiration for the "Olive Technology Services" logo draws from several core concepts:

1. **Nature Meets Technology**: The use of a tree, especially an olive tree, symbolizes growth, peace, and prosperity. In many cultures, the olive tree stands for resilience and endurance. This mirrors the robust and reliable services offered by a technology company. By giving the tree a metallic finish, it marries the natural aspect of the olive tree with the modern, cutting-edge technology that your company offers, especially in the realms of Cloud and SAP services.

2. **Subtle Integration**: The use of subtle tech-inspired icons within the tree's canopy represents the range of services provided â€“ both Cloud and SAP services. Their integration into the tree's design signifies the seamless and integrated solutions that Olive Technology Services offers to its clients.

3. **Elegance & Modernity**: The deep tech blue color chosen for the word "OLIVE" suggests trust, reliability, and sophistication. Blue is often associated with technology and evokes a sense of stability and confidence. The minimalist and modern font for both "OLIVE" and the tagline "Technology Services" emphasizes the company's forward-thinking approach and commitment to modern solutions.

4. **Comprehensive Service Offering**: The tagline "Technology Services" positioned neatly below "OLIVE" underscores the comprehensive range of tech solutions and services that the company provides. It serves as a clear and concise declaration of the company's expertise and domain.


![](../olivets%20logo%203.png)


--------

In essence, the logo encapsulates Olive Technology Services' mission to offer resilient, state-of-the-art technological solutions while maintaining an organic, client-centric approach. The fusion of natural and technological elements in the logo paints a picture of a company that is grounded yet innovative, traditional yet modern, and most importantly, dedicated to growth and excellence.

### NOTE
> This is perliminary run of logo. To be Dumped.
