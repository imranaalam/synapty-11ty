## Brand Logos
The inspiration for the "Olive Technology Services" logo draws from several core concepts:

1. **Nature Meets Technology**: The use of a tree, especially an olive tree, symbolizes growth, peace, and prosperity. In many cultures, the olive tree stands for resilience and endurance. This mirrors the robust and reliable services offered by a technology company. By giving the tree a metallic finish, it marries the natural aspect of the olive tree with the modern, cutting-edge technology that your company offers, especially in the realms of Cloud and SAP services.

2. **Subtle Integration**: The use of subtle tech-inspired icons within the tree's canopy represents the range of services provided – both Cloud and SAP services. Their integration into the tree's design signifies the seamless and integrated solutions that Olive Technology Services offers to its clients.

3. **Elegance & Modernity**: The deep tech blue color chosen for the word "OLIVE" suggests trust, reliability, and sophistication. Blue is often associated with technology and evokes a sense of stability and confidence. The minimalist and modern font for both "OLIVE" and the tagline "Technology Services" emphasizes the company's forward-thinking approach and commitment to modern solutions.

4. **Comprehensive Service Offering**: The tagline "Technology Services" positioned neatly below "OLIVE" underscores the comprehensive range of tech solutions and services that the company provides. It serves as a clear and concise declaration of the company's expertise and domain.


![](../olivets%20logo%203.png)


--------

In essence, the logo encapsulates Olive Technology Services' mission to offer resilient, state-of-the-art technological solutions while maintaining an organic, client-centric approach. The fusion of natural and technological elements in the logo paints a picture of a company that is grounded yet innovative, traditional yet modern, and most importantly, dedicated to growth and excellence.

### NOTE
> This is perliminary run of logo. To be Dumped.
